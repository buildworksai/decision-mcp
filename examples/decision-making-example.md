# Decision Making Example

This example demonstrates how to use the Decision Making tools to make a structured, criteria-based decision about choosing a software vendor.

## Decision: Choose a CRM Software Vendor

Let's work through the decision: "Choose between three CRM vendors for our new customer relationship management system."

### Step 1: Start Decision Session

```json
{
  "tool": "start_decision",
  "arguments": {
    "context": "Choose between three CRM vendors for our new customer relationship management system",
    "description": "We need to select a CRM system to replace our current outdated system. Budget: $50k, Timeline: 6 months, Team size: 10 people",
    "deadline": "2024-03-15"
  }
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "decision-session-001",
    "context": "Choose between three CRM vendors for our new customer relationship management system",
    "criteria": [],
    "options": [],
    "evaluations": [],
